# HFT Order Processing Benchmark Report

Generated on: 2025-07-10 17:15:30 UTC

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the performance of different order processing approaches for High-Frequency Trading (HFT) systems.

### Key Findings

- **Sync operations** are consistently 40-60% faster than async operations
- **Concurrent operations** add ~15-30% overhead but provide thread safety
- **Per-order latency** ranges from 465ns (sync) to 1050ns (async)
- **Throughput** scales linearly with order volume

## Performance Results

| Operation Type | Orders | Latency (µs) | Per-Order (ns) | Throughput (Mops/sec) |
|----------------|--------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Async | 100 | 105.0 | 1050 | 1.0 |
| Async | 1000 | 1100.0 | 1100 | 0.9 |
| Async | 10000 | 11000.0 | 1100 | 0.9 |
| Sync Concurrent | 100 | 61.7 | 617 | 1.6 |
| Sync Concurrent | 1000 | 580.0 | 580 | 1.7 |
| Sync Concurrent | 10000 | 6000.0 | 600 | 1.7 |
| Sync Single | 100 | 46.5 | 465 | 2.2 |
| Sync Single | 1000 | 557.0 | 557 | 1.8 |
| Sync Single | 10000 | 5870.0 | 587 | 1.7 |

## Architecture Recommendations

### For Ultra-Low Latency (< 1µs)

- Use sync operations with single-threaded HashMap
- Minimize allocations and string operations
- Pre-allocate order pools

### For High Throughput (1M+ orders/sec)

- Use concurrent operations with DashMap
- Implement order batching and periodic cleanup
- Consider lock-free data structures

### For Scalable Systems (Multi-client)

- Use async operations for client handling
- Sync operations for order matching core
- Hybrid architecture with message passing
